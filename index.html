 <p style="color: rgb(14, 218, 218);background-color: rgb(197, 155, 100);">Time management is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between different activities. Get it right, and you'll end up working smarter, not harder, to get more done in less time â€“ even when time is tight and pressures are high.</p>
 <h3>It is very important to be conscious of how you spend your time so as not to waste time that is very important.</h3>
